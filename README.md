#Weekend Challenge #1 - Forms

This is a form that collects and stores employee data. I have yet to complete the salary calculator. It's close - currently, the form will print the annual salary & divide it by 12 to show the monthly expense of one employee, but not all.

9.26.16 - I have updated the form so it calculates the salaries & shows the monthly expenditures. There is also a delete button to remove any employee. It does not yet update the total monthly expenditures.

##Features
I created a form that accomplishes several things:
  1. Records employee data:
      - First & Last Name
      - ID Number
      - Job Title
      - Annual Salary
  2. Clears out & stores the data submitted
  3. Adds salaries to calculate the monthly expense
  4. Removes employee from the DOM

  - To do: Keeps salary in the total
