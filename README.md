#Weekend Challenge #1 - Forms

This is a form that collects and stores employee data. I have yet to complete the salary calculator. It's close - currently, the form will print the annual salary & divide it by 12 to show the monthly expense of one employee, but not all.

##Features
I created a form that accomplishes several things:
  1. Records employee data:
      - First & Last Name
      - ID Number
      - Job Title
      - Annual Salary
  2. Clears out & stores the data submitted

  - To do: Adds salaries to calculate the monthly expense
  - To do: Removes employee from the DOM
  - To do: Keeps salary in the total
